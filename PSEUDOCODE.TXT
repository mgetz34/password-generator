PASSWORD GENERATOR

1. I want a password generated randomly
2. I navigate to the application and see a box where the generated password will go 
and a button to generate the password (already constructed)
2. Then, I am presented with a series of prompts to answer that will be variables:

    A. Length of password? can only be 8-128 characters
    B. Include lowercase characters? yes or no
    C. Include uppercase characters? yes or no
    D. Include numbers? yes or no
    D. Include special characters? yes or no 

3. Once all the prompts have been answered w/ at least one variable selected (i.e. length and lowercase)
4. Then a password will be generated matching the above specified criteria 
5. The generated password will be displayed in an alert or written to the page
